{"problem":"We have that $2a + 1 = 1$ and $b - a = 1.$ What is the value of $b$?","level":"Level 1","type":"Prealgebra","solution":"1","explanation":"Since $2a + 1 = 1,$ we find that $2a = 0,$ so $a = 0.$ Therefore, $b - a = b - 0 = b = \\boxed{1}.$","equation":"2a + 1 = 1, ; 2a = 0, ; a = 0. ; b - a = b - 0 = b = 1."}
