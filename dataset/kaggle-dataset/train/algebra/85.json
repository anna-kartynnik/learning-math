{"problem":"If $h(x)$ is a function whose domain is $[-8,8]$, and $g(x)=h\\left(\\frac x2\\right)$, then the domain of $g(x)$ is an interval of what width?","level":"Level 5","type":"Algebra","solution":"32","explanation":"Since we defined $g(x) = h\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$, a real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $\\frac{x}{2}$ is in the domain of $h$.  Therefore, the domain of $g$ consists of all $x$ such that $$-8\\le \\frac x2\\le 8.$$The solutions to this inequality are given by $-16\\le x\\le 16$, so the domain of $g$ is an interval of width $16 - (-16) = \\boxed{32}$.","equation":"g ( x )  = h< = ft ( \\frac{x}{2} )  ;  - 16< = x< = 16 ; 16 -  ( - 16 )  = 32", "equation2": "x = b - a ; b / 2 = 8 ; a / 2 = - 8", "solution2": ["32", "16", "-16"]}
