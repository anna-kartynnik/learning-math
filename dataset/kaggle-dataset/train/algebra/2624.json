{"problem":"What is the product of all real numbers that are doubled when added to their reciprocals?","level":"Level 4","type":"Algebra","solution":"-1","explanation":"Let such a real number be $x$. We have the property that $x+\\frac{1}{x}=2x$, or $x=\\frac{1}{x} \\Rightarrow x^2-1=0$. Thus, the product of the (both real) solutions is $-1\\cdot 1=\\boxed{-1}$.","equation":"x + \\frac1x = 2x ; x = \\frac1x \\Rightarrow x**2 - 1 = 0 ;  - 1 * 1 = - 1"}
