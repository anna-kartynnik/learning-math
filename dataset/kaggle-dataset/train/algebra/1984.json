{"problem":"A gasoline tank is $\\frac{7}{8}$ full. After $12$ gallons have been used, it is half full. How many gallons does this tank hold when it is full?","level":"Level 2","type":"Algebra","solution":"32","explanation":"Let $x$ represent the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full. We know that the difference between $\\frac{7}{8}$ full and $\\frac{1}{2}$ full is 12 gallons, so we set up an equation and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n12&=\\frac{7}{8}x-\\frac{1}{2}x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12&=\\frac{3}{8}x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12\\cdot\\frac{8}{3}&=x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n32&=x\n\\end{align*} The tank holds $\\boxed{32}$ gallons when it is full.","equation":"32"}
