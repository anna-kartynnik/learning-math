{"problem":"A square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 5$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$. What is the area of the square?","level":"Level 5","type":"Algebra","solution":"21","explanation":"The points of intersection of the line $y = 5$ and $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ are found when $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 5$. Thus we have the quadratic  $x^2 + 3x -3=0$. By the quadratic formula,  $$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -3}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, which will give a side length of the square. The difference is $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2} = \\sqrt{21}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $(\\sqrt{21})^2 = \\boxed{21}$.","equation":"y = 5 ; y = x**2 + 3x + 2 ; x**2 + 3x + 2 = 5 ; x**2 + 3x - 3 = 0 ; 2 * \\frac\\sqrt212 = \\sqrt21 ;  ( \\sqrt21 ) **2 = 21"}
