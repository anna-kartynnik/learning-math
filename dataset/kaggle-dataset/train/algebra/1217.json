{"problem":"The equation $x^2+12x=73$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?","level":"Level 4","type":"Algebra","solution":"115","explanation":"Completing the square, we add $(12\/2)^2=36$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+12x+36=109 \\Rightarrow (x+6)^2=109$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+6=\\sqrt{109}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{109}-6$. Thus, $a=109$ and $b=6$, so $a+b=\\boxed{115}$.","equation":" ( 12 \/ 2 ) **2 = 36 ; x**2 + 12x + 36 = 109 \\Rightarrow ( x + 6 ) **2 = 109 ; x + 6 = \\sqrt109 ; x = \\sqrt109 - 6 ; a = 109 ; b = 6 ; a + b = 115"}
