{"problem":"The roots of the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$ sum to 6 and multiply to 10. What is the value of $m+n$?","level":"Level 5","type":"Algebra","solution":"32","explanation":"In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, in the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$, the roots sum to $\\frac{m}{2}=6$ and multiply to $\\frac{n}{2}=10$. Solving the first equation, we see that $m=12$ and solving the second equation, we see that $n=20$. Therefore, $m+n=12+20=\\boxed{32}$.","equation":"2x**2 - mx + n = 0 ; \\fracm2 = 6 ; \\fracn2 = 10 ; m = 12 ; n = 20 ; m + n = 12 + 20 = 32", "equation2": "y = m + n ; m / 2 = 6 ; n / 2 = 10", "solution2": ["32", "12", "20"]}
