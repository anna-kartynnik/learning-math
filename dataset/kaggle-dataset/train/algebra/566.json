{"problem":"What is the value of $y$ in the equation $\\frac{30}{50}=\\sqrt{\\frac{y}{50}}$?","level":"Level 3","type":"Algebra","solution":"18","explanation":"Squaring both sides, we have $\\frac{30^2}{50^2}=\\frac{y}{50}$. Solving for $y$ yields $y=900\/50=\\boxed{18}$.","equation":" ( ( 30**2 ) \/ ( 50**2 ) ) = \\fracy50 ; y = 900 \/ 50 = 18"}
