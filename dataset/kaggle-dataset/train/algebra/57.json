{"problem":"Each successive term in the sequence $2048, 512, 128, x,\ny, 2, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{8},...$ is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. What is the value of $x + y$?","level":"Level 2","type":"Algebra","solution":"40","explanation":"Call the constant $r$. To get from $2$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiplied by $r$, so $2r = \\frac{1}{2}$, or $r = \\frac{1}{4}$. To get from 128 to $x$, we multiply by $\\frac{1}{4}$, so $x = 128 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 32$. To get from 32 to $y$, we multiply by $\\frac{1}{4}$, so $y = 32 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 8$. Thus, $x + y = 32 + 8 = \\boxed{40}$.","equation":"2r =  ( ( 1 ) \/ ( 2 ) )  ; r =  ( ( 1 ) \/ ( 4 ) )  ; x = 128 *  ( ( 1 ) \/ ( 4 ) )  = 32 ; y = 32 *  ( ( 1 ) \/ ( 4 ) )  = 8 ; x + y = 32 + 8 = 40", "equation2": "a = x + y ; x = 128 * q ; y = x * q ; 2048 * q = 512", "solution2": ["40", "32", "8", "0.25"]}
