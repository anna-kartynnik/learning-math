{"problem":"The bacteria in a lab dish double in number every four hours. If 500 bacteria cells are in the dish now, in how many hours will there be exactly 32,000 bacteria?","level":"Level 3","type":"Algebra","solution":"24","explanation":"32000 bacteria is $32000\/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours.","equation":"32000 \/ 500 = 64 ; 64 = 2**6 ; 4 * 6 = 24", "equation2": "x = 4 * a ; 2 ^ a = b ; b = 32000 / 500", "solution2": ["24", "6", "64"]}
