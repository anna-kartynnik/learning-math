{"problem":"The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac{2}{7}$. What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n","level":"Level 5","type":"Number Theory","solution":"417","explanation":"The nearest fractions to $\\frac{2}{7}$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac{2}{6}, \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}$ anyway. For $\\frac{2}{7}$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac{2}{7} \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac{1}{4} \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.","equation":"\\frac{2}{6}, \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4} ; r = .2679, .3095 ; .2679 < = r < = .3095 ; 3095 - 2679 + 1 = 417"}
