{"problem":"An eight-sided die has its faces numbered from 1 to 8. What is the expected value of the roll of the die?","level":"Level 2","type":"Counting & Probability","solution":"4.5","explanation":"The expected value of one roll is the average of all the outcomes, or $E = \\dfrac{1}{8}(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 8) = \\boxed{4.5}$.","equation":"E = ( ( 1 ) \/ ( 8 ) ) ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 )  = 4.5"}
