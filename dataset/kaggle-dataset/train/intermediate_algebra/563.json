{"problem":"For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}-ci\\right| = \\frac{3}{4}$?","level":"Level 2","type":"Intermediate Algebra","solution":"2","explanation":"We have $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac{1}{4}}$, so $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}-ci\\right| = \\frac{3}{4}$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{3}{4}$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac{5}{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}-ci\\right| = \\frac{3}{4}$ means that the complex number $\\frac{1}{2}-ci$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac{3}{4}$.  The complex number $\\frac{1}{2}-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.","equation":"< = ft|\\frac{1}{2} - ci| = \\sqrt\\frac{1}{2}**2 +  ( - c ) **2 = \\sqrtc**2 + \\frac{1}{4} ; < = ft|\\frac{1}{2} - ci| = \\frac{3}{4} ; \\sqrtc**2 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} ; c**2 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{16} ; c**2 = \\frac{5}{16} ; c = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} ; c = - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} ; < = ft|\\frac{1}{2} - ci| = \\frac{3}{4}"}
